ðŸŒŸ Storyline Example:
You are building a hotel management system for a luxury resort. The hotel offers both luxury and deluxe rooms.
When a customer books a room, the system should store which customer booked which room.
The system should also allow the hotel staff to check which rooms are booked and by whom.
Make sure to handle cases where a room is already booked or unavailable.
